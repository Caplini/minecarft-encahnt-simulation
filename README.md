# minecarft-encahnt-simulation
simulation of the minecart Liberian villager enchanted book odds

Very basic with sloppy code written while trying to get a unbreaking 3 villger trade.

This code simulates 1,000,000 switches of the enchanted book then prints the amount of switches it would take of the lectern (around 103.792899).
